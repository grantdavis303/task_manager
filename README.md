# Task Manager

### There is currently no live deployment of this application.

To set up this code locally, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ bundle install
$ rails db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
$ rails s
```
This will install any missing gems, create a new database, create a few default tasks (to see the functionality right away), as well as run a local server.

Once the server is live, navigate to [LocalHost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
